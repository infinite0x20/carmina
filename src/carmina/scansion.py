"""
This module contains functions for syllabification and metrical
analysis of Latin text.

It includes:
- A syllabification function that splits a Latin line into syllables.
- A function to check whether a syllable is long or short based on
  Latin metrical rules.

Update as of 13 June 2025:
    The syllabify_word function does not properly divide the syllables
    in cases where a single consonant is followed by a consonant cluster.

    The is_long function needs to be reworked to consider the context of
    the entire line rather than looking at each syllable individually.
    Currently, it does not properly reflect the algorithmic process used
    in manual scansion to determine syllable length.

    As the hexameter_line and hexameter_text functions both depend on
    these two functions working correctly, neither will produce the
    correct output.
