# User Stories

The following are some user stories to illustrate potential use cases and users for the `carmina` functionality.

## Undergrad student

Virgil is an undergrad Latin major working on his poetry composition homework. He wants to use the `carmina` package to scan the epic he's written to verify that his lines are all in dactylic hexameter. He'd like the function to go line-by-line and output exactly which syllables are short and which are long. He's never taken a programming class before because all his time has been spent on his Latin degree.

## Grad student

Cicero is working on his PhD. He wants to use the `carmina` package to track instances of the same phrase in the speeches he's analyzing. He's also interested in figuring out how often the speeches use hypotactic versus paratactic sentence structure. He's taken a few programming classes and understands how procedural programming works in Python.

## DH Scholar

Vitruvius is interested in looking at alliteration across dactylic hexameter. He doesn't know much Latin, but he does know how to use Python for text analysis. He's done alliteration studies in other natural languages. He would like to use `carmina` to break down alliteration across several lines of hexameter.

## DH Scholar 2

Hypatia is working with Vitruvius's lab, but she's more interested in looking at alliterative figures within the same line. She knows more Latin, but she's new to Python. She will need an intuitive guide to use `carmina`'s alliteration analysis functions in each line of interest.

## New Latin Student

Martial is new to Latin epic, but he doesn't know a lot about scansion. However, his Latin class has a scansion assignment due tomorrow, and he doesn't know how to do it! On the other hand, he does know some Python, and he's familiar enough with Latin to know how to read it. He'll try to use the hexameter scansion function from `carmina` to finish his homework.
